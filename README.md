``AnyMap``, a safe and convenient store for one value of each type
==================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chris-morgan/anymap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chris-morgan/anymap)

If you’re familiar with Go and Go web frameworks, you may have come across the common “environment” pattern for storing data related to the request. It’s typically something like ``map[string]interface{}`` and is accessed with arbitrary strings which may clash and type assertions which are a little unwieldy and must be used very carefully. (Personally I would consider that it is just *asking* for things to blow up in your face.) In a language like Go, lacking in generics, this is the best that can be done; such a thing cannot possibly be made safe without generics.

As another example of such an interface, JavaScript objects are exactly the same—a mapping of string keys to arbitrary values. (There it is actually *more* dangerous, because methods and fields/attributes/properties are on the same plane.)

Fortunately, we can do better than these things in Rust. Our type system is quite equal to easy, robust expression of such problems.

The ``AnyMap`` type is a friendly wrapper around a ``HashMap<TypeId, Box<Any>>``, exposing a nice, easy typed interface, perfectly safe and absolutely robust.

What this means is that in an ``AnyMap`` you may store zero or one values for every type.

Instructions
------------

Cargo all the way: it is `anymap` on crates.io.

There are a couple of optional features on the `anymap` crate:

- `clone`: if enabled, your `AnyMap` will require contained types to implement `Clone` and will itself satisfy `Clone`.

- `concurrent`: if enabled, your `AnyMap` will require contained types to satisfy `Send` and `Sync` and will itself satisfy `Send` and `Sync`.

These can be combined if desired.

For users of the nightly instead of the beta of rustc there are a couple of things behind the `nightly` feature like a `drain` method on the `RawAnyMap` and a more efficient hashing technique which makes lookup in the map a tad faster.
